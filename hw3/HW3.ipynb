    "## Instructions\n",
    "* Review the academic integrity and collaboration policies on the course website.\n",
    "  * This assignment must be completed individually.\n",
    "* All solutions must be written in this notebook.\n",
    "  * This includes the theoretical problems, for which you **must** write your answers in Markdown cells (using LaTeX when appropriate).\n",
    "  * Programming aspects of the assignment must be completed using Python in this notebook.\n",
    "* If you want to modify the skeleton code, you may do so. It has only been provided as a framework for your solution.\n",
    "* You may use Python packages (such as NumPy and SciPy) for basic linear algebra, but you may not use packages that directly solve the problem.\n",
    "  * If you are unsure about using a specific package or function, then ask the instructor and/or teaching assistants for clarification.\n",
    "* You must submit this notebook exported as a PDF. You must also submit this notebook as `.ipynb` file.\n",
    "  * Submit both files (`.pdf` and `.ipynb`) on Gradescope.\n",
    "  * **You must mark the PDF pages associated with each question in Gradescope. If you fail to do so, we may dock points.**\n",
    "* It is highly recommended that you begin working on this assignment early.\n",
    "* **Late policy: assignments submitted late will receive a 15% grade reduction for each 12 hours late (i.e., 30% per day). Assignments will not be accepted 72 hours after the due date. If you require an extension (for personal reasons only) to a due date, you must request one as far in advance as possible. Extensions requested close to or after the due date will only be granted for clear emergencies or clearly unforeseeable circumstances.**"

    "## Problem 1: Photometric Stereo, Specularity Removal [20 pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this problem is to implement a couple of different algorithms that reconstruct a surface using the concept of Lambertian photometric stereo. Additionally, you will implement the specular removal technique of [Mallick et al.](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~zickler/download/photodiff_cvpr05_preprint.pdf), which enables photometric stereo to be performed on certain non-Lambertian materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can assume a Lambertian reflectance function once specularities are removed. However, note that the albedo is unknown and non-constant in the images you will use.\n",
    "\n",
    "As input, your program should take in multiple images along with the light source direction for each image. Each image is associated with only a single light, and hence a single direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "You will use synthetic images and specular sphere images as data. These images are stored in `.pickle` files which have been graciously provided by Satya Mallick. Each `.pickle` file contains\n",
    "\n",
    "* `im1`, `im2`, `im3`, `im4`, ... images.\n",

    "Implement the photometric stereo technique described in the lecture slides and in Forsyth and Ponce 2.2.4 (*Photometric Stereo: Shape from Multiple Shaded Images*). Your program should have two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read in the images and corresponding light source directions, and estimate the surface normals and albedo map.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reconstruct the depth map from the surface normals. You should first try the naive scanline-based \"shape by integration\" method described in the book and in lecture. (You are required to implement this.) For comparison, you should also integrate using the Horn technique which is already implemented for you in the `horn_integrate` function. Note that for good results you will often want to run the `horn_integrate` function with 10000-100000 iterations, which will take a while. For your final submission, we will require that you run Horn integration for 1000 (one thousand) iterations or more in each case. But for debugging, it is suggested that you keep the number of iterations low.\n",
