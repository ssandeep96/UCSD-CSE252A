    "* It is highly recommended that you begin working on this assignment early.\n",
    "* **Late policy: assignments submitted late will receive a 15% grade reduction for each 12 hours late (i.e., 30% per day). Assignments will not be accepted 72 hours after the due date. If you require an extension (for personal reasons only) to a due date, you must request one as far in advance as possible. Extensions requested close to or after the due date will only be granted for clear emergencies or clearly unforeseeable circumstances.**"

So, for example if (x, y) = (0, 0), this is really the point (-12, 0, 1) in world coordinates, while if (u, v) = (0, 0) this is the point (12, 0, 1).\n",

Write an analytic expression giving the disparity of a point on this line after it projects onto the two images, as a function of its position in the right image. So your expression should only involve the variables u and d (for disparity). Your expression only needs to be valid for points on the line that are in front of the cameras, i.e. with z > 1."

    "In this problem we will play around with sparse stereo matching methods. You will work on two image pairs, a warrior figure and a figure from the Matrix movies. These files both contain two images, two camera matrices, and two sets of corresponding points (extracted by manually clicking the images). For illustration, I have run my code on a third image pair (dino1.png, dino2.png). This data is also provided for you to debug your code, but **you should only report results on warrior and matrix**. In other words, where I include one (or a pair) of images in the assignment below, you will provide the same thing but for BOTH matrix and warrior. Note that the matrix image pair is harder, in the sense that the matching algorithms we are implementing will not work quite as well. You should expect good results, however, on warrior."

    "The first thing we need to do is to build a corner detector. This should be done according to http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa19/cse252A-a/lec7.pdf. You should fill in the function <code>corner_detect</code> below, and take as input <code>corner_detect(image, nCorners, smoothSTD, windowSize)</code> where smoothSTD is the standard deviation of the smoothing kernel and windowSize is the window size for corner detector and non maximum suppression. In the lecture the corner detector was implemented using a hard threshold. Do not do that but instead return the nCorners strongest corners after non-maximum suppression. This way you can control exactly how many corners are returned. Run your code on all four images (with nCorners = 20) and show outputs as shown below. You may find scipy.ndimage.filters.gaussian_filter easy to use for smoothing. In this problem, try the following different standard deviation ($\\sigma$) parameters for the Gausian smoothing kernel: 0.5, 1, 2 and 4. For a particular $\\sigma$, you should take the kernel size to be $6\\times\\sigma$ (add $1$ if the kernel size is even). So for example if $\\sigma=2$, corner detection kernel size should be $13$. This should be followed throughtout all experiments in this assignment.\n",

    "### Image Rectification [5 pts]\n",
    " An interesting case for epipolar geometry occurs when two images are parallel to each other. In this case, there is no rotation component involved between the two images and the essential matrix is $\\texttt{E}=[\\boldsymbol{T_{x}}]\\boldsymbol{R}=[\\boldsymbol{T_{x}}]$. Also if you observe the epipolar lines $\\boldsymbol{l}$ and $\\boldsymbol{l^{'}}$ for parallel images, they are horizontal and consequently, the corresponding epipolar lines share the same vertical coordinate. Therefore the process of making images parallel becomes useful while discerning the relationships between corresponding points in images.\n",
    " Rectifying a pair of images can also be done for uncalibrated camera images (i.e. we do not require the camera matrix of intrinsic parameters). Using the fundamental matrix we can find the pair of epipolar lines $\\boldsymbol{l_i}$ and $\\boldsymbol{l^{'}_i}$ for each of the correspondences. The intersection of these lines will give us the respective epipoles $\\boldsymbol{e}$ and $\\boldsymbol{e^{'}}$.  Now to make the epipolar lines to be parallel we need to map the epipoles to infinity. Hence , we need to find a homography that maps the epipoles to infinity. The method to find the homography has been implemented for you. You can read more about the method used to estimate the homography in the paper \"Theory and Practice of Projective Rectification\" by Richard Hartley.\n",
